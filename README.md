# spell-check-LSTM
The objective of this project is to build a model that can take a sentence with spelling mistakes as input, and output the same sentence, but with the mistakes corrected. The data that we will use for this project will be twenty popular books from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads). Our model is designed using LSTM(Keras).
